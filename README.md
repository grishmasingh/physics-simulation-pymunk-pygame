# Physics Simulation using Pymunk & Pygame


<h2>Project Overview</h2>


Hello Everyone or shall I say Hello World to my fellow programmers  :technologist:

This project is a Physics Simulation game using Pygame and Pymunk modules where every click drops a picture of a cat that collides with the stationary object.
Pymunk calculates the Physics behind the game whereas Pygame helps visualise it 🖼️ 🔢

Behind Every collision are some mathematical calculations to ensure the png object hits the stationary objects perfectly. 📐


I really enjoyed developing this small game and although it has room for improvement, I am really excited to create more games using these modules 🎮
